# Library Configuration

The Library Configuration manages how Pipelex organizes, loads, and handles libraries in your project. Libraries in Pipelex include pipelines, LLM integrations, LLM decks, and templates.

## Directory Structure

The library system uses two main root directories:

- Internal library root (`pipelex/libraries`): Contains the base libraries shipped with Pipelex
- Exported library root (`pipelex_libraries`): Contains your project's libraries, including copies of base libraries

### Standard Paths

```
pipelex_libraries/         # Exported library root
├── pipelines/             # Pipeline definitions
│   ├── base_library/      # Base pipelines from Pipelex
│   └── your_pipelines/    # Your custom pipelines
├── llm_integrations/      # LLM integration configurations
├── llm_deck/              # LLM model configurations
└── templates/             # Template files
```

## Library Loading Process

1. **Domain Loading**:

    - Loads domain definitions first
    - Each domain must be defined exactly once
    - Supports system prompts and structure templates

2. **Concept Loading**:

    - Loads native concepts first
    - Loads custom concepts from TOML files
    - Validates concept definitions and relationships

3. **Pipe Loading**:

    - Loads pipe definitions after concepts
    - Validates pipe configurations
    - Links pipes with their respective domains

## Configuration Options

### Path Configuration

All paths are configurable through class variables in `LibraryConfig`:

```python
package_name = "pipelex"
internal_library_root = "libraries"
exported_library_root = "pipelex_libraries"
exported_pipelines_path = "pipelex_libraries/pipelines"
exported_llm_integrations_path = "pipelex_libraries/llm_integrations"
exported_llm_deck_path = "pipelex_libraries/llm_deck"
exported_templates_path = "pipelex_libraries/templates"
```

### Library Initialization

Use the CLI command to initialize libraries:
```bash
pipelex init libraries
```

This will:

1. Create the necessary directory structure
2. Copy base libraries to your project
3. Set up initial configuration files

### Library Export Options

When exporting libraries to your project:

- Use `overwrite=True` to force update existing files
- Preserve custom overrides in `llm_deck/overrides.toml`
- Maintain directory structure and initialization files

## Validation

The library manager performs several validation steps:

1. **LLM Deck Validation**:

    - Ensures LLM configurations are complete
    - Validates model settings

2. **Concept Library Validation**:

    - Checks concept relationships
    - Validates concept definitions

3. **Pipe Library Validation**:

    - Verifies pipe configurations
    - Checks domain relationships

4. **Domain Library Validation**:

    - Ensures domain completeness
    - Validates domain relationships

## Error Handling

The library system includes specific error types:

- `LibraryError`: Base error for library issues
- `LibraryParsingError`: For TOML parsing issues
- `ConceptLibraryError`: For concept-related issues
- `PipeLibraryError`: For pipe-related issues
- `LLMDeckNotFoundError`: For missing LLM configurations

## Best Practices

1. **Organization**:

    - Keep related concepts and pipes in the same TOML file
    - Use meaningful domain names
    - Structure complex libraries using subdirectories

2. **Validation**:

    - Run `pipelex validate all` after making changes
    - Check for domain consistency
    - Verify concept relationships

3. **Customization**:

    - Use `overrides.toml` for local LLM settings
    - Keep custom pipelines separate from base library
    - Document domain-specific configurations

Think on the pipeline requirements: what are the pipeline's inputs and what is the expected output?

- Keep domain and pipe codes short, lowercase, and meaningful.
- In concept, map ConceptName (PascalCase, singular) to its natural language definition string. Do not redefine native concepts (Text, Image, PDF, TextAndImages, Number, Page).
- In pipe, define at least one pipe that accomplishes the main goal implied by the requirements. Use operators/controllers supported by Pipelex (e.g., PipeLLM, PipeOcr, PipeSequence...).
- Ensure all input variables referenced in prompts are listed in the pipe `inputs`.
